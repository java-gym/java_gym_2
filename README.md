# Java Gym 2

The second java Challenge!

Update (only) YourStrategy.java to solve the classic minesweeper puzzle. Run tests to check your solution.

The solution which gets most minefields right wins. If that is a tie, the fastest one wins. But of course, anyone who solves it is a winner!

More automatic tests may be added in the near future.

Details:

* Width and height are between 10 and 100 cells.
* The number of mines is between 1 mine and 30% mines.
